# Flow Engineering

This project aim to analyze the source code of complex project, both under alogirthmic than mathematic point of view, to retrieve a general flow, or map, of its functioning.

In this moment the NodeJS script is able to read a particular file, extract its ast using Python built-in functions and reorganizate it to have a general view of used functions and variable.

Is just a little achievement, but pretty cool to see.
